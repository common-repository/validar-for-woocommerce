== Description ==

[Main Site](https://validar.io/) | [Support](https://validar.io/contact) | [Docs](https://docs.validar.io/)

Validar is the easiest and most effective way to validate shipping addresses for your WooCommerce store in WordPress.  We also support [Shopify shipping address validation](https://apps.shopify.com/validar-address-validation) as well.

**NOTE:**
> **Requires: WooCommerce 3.0** or newer and a free Validar account

= ** Bad or Invalid Shipping Addresses can cost you a lot of money ** =

_The average merchant wastes $18 per order when a shipment needs to be resent due to a bad or invalid address._  On average, about 4.7% of customers will make mistakes on their address during checkout. Those errors will cost you money! If you have 10000 orders and around 5% of them need to be resent (500), _that's roughly $2,700 out of your pocket to fix something you could have caught before the package ever left your hands_.  Address validation with Validar helps you avoid unshippable addresses, or enforce rules like "No PO Boxes" so you can prevent problems with your carriers before they happen.  

= ** More than just "Address Validation" ** =

_Validar also allows you to use 'shipping rules' to prevent delivery problems in advance._  Much more than just address validation, Validar allows you to turn on rules like "No Post Office Boxes" to prevent UPS from failing to deliver your packages, or other rules like "No Military Addresses" which can cause issues for other carriers.  We can also follow up with your customers via email if we detect an issue with their shipping address, too (COMING SOON!)

= ** Fully customizable to your store ** =

_Validar lets you control all of the text and colors we use for the messages so it's a perfect match for your store._  Every dialog, button, text field, label and title can be customized with your specific language or text of choice.  The colors of everything can be set to perfectly match your store.  We'll look like a seamless part of your checkout experience.

= ** Validar is built by a team with an established track record ** =

_Validar was created by the same team that built [Recapture Abandoned Cart Recovery for WooCommerce]((https://recapture.io/abandoned-carts-woocommerce)._  We're not new to ecommerce and it shows.  Our success is your success, period.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does Validar work? =

Validar installs on your Thank You page during checkout.  We'll pull the shipping address entered by your customer and check it for obvious errors (e.g. incorrect postal code for the address) and check it against any rules you might have active (e.g. "No Post Office Boxes").  If there are any problems, we'll ask the customer immediately to help fix it, or to accept our suggested changes.  This small addition to your checkout helps you save money by avoiding shipping issues before they happen.
